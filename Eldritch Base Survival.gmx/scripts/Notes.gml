- Health System is Sanity entirely
   - Hits cause you mental damage, slowly driving you insane, which in turn, the higher your insanity, the more and stronger monsters will be
   - Certain recipes you craft will require your insanity to create, which “heals” you by removing insanity from you
   - Others will require an increase in insanity because they are dangerous Eldritch things
   - Temporary psychotics can reduce your insanity by numbing your mind, but are at a cost later down the line so you better be prepared for when they wear off
   - Killing Eldritch creatures releases small amounts of corruption which can be used to create/run certain machines and recipes, or it could be used Alchemically to create a way to reduce insanity
